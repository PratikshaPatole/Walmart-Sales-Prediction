# Walmart-Sales-Prediction
The dataset contains weekly sales and other information for 45 different Walmart stores. Do some EDA and data cleansing to fix some formatting issues.
Also, we are trying to find answers for below questions:

1.Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012?
2.which store has maximum weekly sales?
3.Do holidays have impact on sales? negative or positive?
4.Draw scatter plot of monthly sales and provide your observations
5.Can you predict Weekly Sales using other columns, either with a Random Forest Algorithm or a Support Vector Machine? 
6. Sometimes predictions from other columns is challenging. In that case, model Weekly Sales column for years 2010 and 2011 with pymc3 and use that model to predict sales for every month in 2012.
